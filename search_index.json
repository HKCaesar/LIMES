this documentation","keywords":"","body":"\nLIMES Documentation\nThis document aims to be a comprehensive guide to LIMES.\nIt is subdivided into four parts:\n\nthis getting started guide, which introduces the reader to LIMES and shows how to install it\nan user manual which details how to use and configure the LIMES java application\na developer manual which describes the internal design and the fundamental building blocks of LIMES for those who want to either extend it or embed it into their own software products\na miscellaneous section, featuring a FAQ and release notes\n\nWhat is

LIMES is a hybrid framework that combines the mathematical\ncharacteristics of metric spaces as well prefix-, suffix- and position\nfiltering to compute pessimistic approximations of the similarity of\ninstances. These approximations are then used to filter out a large\namount of those instance pairs that do not suffice the mapping\nconditions. By these means, LIMES can reduce the number of comparisons\nneeded during the mapping process by several orders of magnitude and\ncomplexity without losing a single link.\n\nThe LIMES framework consists of eight main modules of which each can be extended to accommodate new or improved functionality. The central module of LIMES is the controller module, which coordinates the matching process. The matching process is carried out as follows: First, the controller calls the configuration module, which reads the configuration file and extracts all the information necessary to carry out the comparison of instances, including the URL of the SPARQL-endpoints of source (S) and the target (T) knowledge bases, the restrictions on the instances to map (e.g., their type), the expression of the metric to be used and the threshold to be used. \nGiven that the configuration file is valid w.r.t. the LIMES Specification Language (LSL), the query module is called. This module uses the configuration for the target and source knowledge bases to retrieve instances and properties from the SPARQL-endpoints of the source and target knowledge bases that adhere to the restrictions specified in the configuration file. The query module writes its output into a file by invoking the cache module. Once all instances have been stored in the cache, the controller chooses between performing Link Discovery or Machine Learning. For Link Discovery, LIMES will re-write, plan and execute the Link Specification (LS) included in the configuration file, by calling the rewriter, planner and engine modules resp. The main goal of LD is to identify the set of links (mapping) that satisfy the conditions opposed by the input LS. For Machine Learning, LIMES calls the machine learning algorithm included in the configuration file, to identify an appropriate LS to link S and T. Then it proceeds in executing the LS. For both the tasks, the mapping will be stored in the output file chosen by the user in the configuration file. The results are finally stored into an RDF or an XML file.\nThe advantages of LIMESâ€™ approach are manifold. First, it implements\nhighly time-optimized mappers, making it a complexity class faster\nthan other Link Discovery Frameworks. Thus, the larger the problem, the\nfaster LIMES is w.r.t. other Link Discovery Frameworks. Secondly, LIMES \nsupports a large set of string, numeric, topological and temporal similarity metrics, \nthat provide the user with the opportunity to perform various comparisons between resources.\nIn addition, LIMES is guaranteed to lead to exactly the same matching as a brute\nforce approach while at the same time reducing significantly the number\nof comparisons. In addition, LIMES supports a large number of input\nand output formats and can easily be extended with custom\nalgorithms, datatypes, preprocessing functions and more thank\nto its modular architecture.\nIn general, LIMES can be used to set links between two data sources,\ne.g., a novel data source created by a data publisher and existing data\nsource such as DBpedia. This functionality can also be used to\ndetect duplicates within one data source for knowledge curation. The\nonly requirement to carry out these tasks is a simple XML- or RDF-based\nconfiguration file. \nThe purpose of this user manual is to\n\nshow the various ways in which LIMES can be invoked and\nexplicate the LIMES Configuration Language (LCL) so as allow users to generate their own configurations.\n\n"},"user_manual/running_limes.html":{"url":"user_manual/running_limes.html","title":"Running LIMES","keywords":"","body":"Running LIMES \nLIMES can be run in three modes: CLI client, CLI server and GUI client.\nAll modes offer the same functionality but over different interfaces to support a variety of use cases.    \nClient\nFor this purpose, simply run\njava -jar path_to_limes.jar config.xml [OPTIONS...]\n\nThe following optional command line flags and options are available:\n\n-f $format sets the format of configuration file.

Since machine learning is implemented separately \nin the GUI, only configurations with metric expressions are accepted. If you load a configuration with machine learning \ninstructions, as much information as possible will be saved, but you have to run the machine learning through the GUI.\nSave Config: Save a configuration to a file (only possible, after loading a configuration or creating a new configuration)\nExit \n\n\nLayout, which handles the layout of the current metric\nRefresh Layout: Rearranges the nodes of the metric in a tree-like structure\nDelete Graph: Delete the current metric leaving only an output node\n\n\nLearn, where all the machine learning functionality of the GUI can be accessed(These features are only available when a configuration is loaded):\nActive Learning\nBatch Learning\nUnsupervised Learning\n\n\n\nToolbox\n\nOn the left you can find the toolbox containing everything you need to build your own metric after you loaded/made a configuration\n\nSource/Target Properties: The properties you want to link (if you did not load or create a configuration these are empty)\nMeasures: All the measures you can use to link properties\nOperators: All the operators you can use to combine measures\n\n\n\nMetric Builder\n\nThe metric builder eases the process of complex link specification creation, especially for end users\nwith limited programming experience. In particular, you can visually link the various atomic link\nspecification nodes to create complex link specification with ease.\nHow to create a new configuration\nEndpoint configuration\nAfter clicking on File -> New a window pops up in which the source and target endpoints of the new configuration can be configured:  \n\nEndpointURL: Either a URL of a SPARQL Endpoint is entered here, or the filepath to a local endpoint. \nFiles can also be entered more easily by pressing the little green button with the file symbol which opens a file chooser dialog.\nID/Namespace: Source/Target Endpoint can be given a name (optional)\nGraph: Specify the graph, if this is left empty, the default graph will be used\nPage size: How many pages of the endpoint should be fetched? (-1 = all)\n\nLet's use http://dbpedia.org/sparql as source endpoint and http://linkedgeodata.org/sparql as target endpoint URL.\nWe enter dbpedia as source ID and lgd as target ID:\n\nPressing Next gets you to the next step:\nClass matching\n\nA source and target class must be selected by clicking on it to continue. Some classes have subclasses which can be accessed by clicking on the arrow besides them.\nWe click on HistoricPlace from dbpedia and HistoricThing from lgd.\nThe Next step is:\nProperty Matching\n\nClicking on the available properties moves them to the bottom container, where the already added properties can be seen. If you\nchange your mind, clicking on added properties moves them back up. Alternatively all available properties can be added with the button Add All.\nAt least one source and one target property has to be added.\nLet's take rdfs:label for both. Since the properties are alphabetically sorted you can find those towards the bottom of each list.\nPress Finish and you are now ready to build a metric!\nHow to Create a New Link Specification\nGet the Nodes You Need Into the Metric Builder\nClicking on elements from the toolbox makes nodes appear in the metric builder. Click on both rdfs:label properties you have.\nNow we need a measure to check the similarity between those properties. Let's choose cosine for example.\nStart Linking\nRight clicking the nodes creates a small context menu for the node. If you click Link To you can\nlink the node with an appropriate other node. The following links are permitted:\n\nproperty -> measure\nmeasure -> output\nmeasure -> operator\noperator -> output\n\nAlso operator and measure need two nodes that link to them. The context menu also gives you the possibility to Close it or Delete\nthe node. If you want to delete a link, just right-click the arrow. \nLet's link our properties with cosine and the measure with output.\nDefine Thresholds\nIf you want you can define a Acceptance Threshold and Verification Threshold \n(specifying files is not yet implemented here). \nRunning Your Linkspecification\nIf you followed the steps, your Linkspecification should look something like this:\n\nIf you want to Run it, just click on the button in the bottom right corner.\nResults\nAfter the progress popup vanished you should see your results in a new window.\n\nIn the top left you have the possibility to save them into a file. The relation between them will be defined as owl:sameAs.\nMachine Learning in the GUI\nSince finding a good metric expression can be hard, we also have implemented machine learning algorithms in the GUI. There are\nthree different types of algorithms you can use:\n\nActive Learning\nBatch Learning\nUnsupervised Learning\n\nTo use any of these algorithms you have to either create a new config or load one from file.\nIn the menu bar click on Learn and choose the type you want to use. A new window will pop up. In the top left corner you will\nfind a drop-down menu, showing you which algorithms implement the chosen learning type. After you click on your desired algorithm,\nthe window will fill with elements you can use the set the parameters.\n\nActive Learning\nIf you are happy with the parameters you must click on Learn in the bottom right corner. After the progress popup vanishes you\nwill see a new window, where the algorithm wants you to label link candidates as matches or non-matches.\n\nYou can click on Learn again and another iteration starts. If you don't want another iteration, you can click on Get Results\nand a new view with results will pop up. This time you also have the possibility to Save Linkspecification in the bottom left corner.\nThis will put the metric to the metric builder and you can save this configuration if you want.\nBatch Learning\nThis learning type only takes one iteration and you have to provide a file containing the training mapping. \n\nThe file can be either CSV or some kind of RDF. For CSV, the first line contains the properties on which you want to match, and\nthe following lines the matched properties of the instance, that are matches. For example:\nid1,id2\nhttp://www.okkam.org/oaie/person1-Person2190,http://www.okkam.org/oaie/person2-Person2191\nIf you use RDF a mapping has owl:sameAs as predicate. For example:\n   .\nOf course the more training data you provide the better the algorithm can learn. After you click on Save the learning will start.\nUnsupervised Learning\nThis is the type that needs the least effort from the user. You just click on Learn and after the algorithm is finished, \nthe results will be presented.\n"},"user_manual/configuration_file/":{"url":"user_manual/configuration_file/","title":"Writing Configuration Files","keywords":"","body":"Components of a LIMES XML Configuration File\nA LIMES configuration file consists of ten parts, of which some are optional.\nMetadata\nThe metadata tag always consists of the following bits of XML:\n\n\n\n\nPrefixes\nDefining a prefix in a LIMES file demands setting two values: \n The namespace that will be addressed by the prefix's label\n\n    http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\n    rdf\n\n\nHere, we set the prefix rdf to correspond to http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#. A LIMES link specification can contain as many prefixes as required.\nData Sources\nLIMES computes links between items contained in two Linked Data sources dubbed source and target. Both source and target need to be configured using the same tags. An example of a configuration for both data sources is shown below.\n\n    mesh\n    http://mesh.bio2rdf.org/sparql\n    ?y\n    5000\n    ?y rdf:type meshr:Concept\n    dc:title\n    sparql\n    \n\n    linkedct\n    http://data.linkedct.org/sparql\n    ?x\n    5000\n    ?x rdf:type linkedct:condition\n    linkedct:condition_name\n\n\nSix properties need to be set. \n\nEach data source must be given an ID via the tag ID.\nThe endpoint of the data source needs to be explicated via the ENDPOINT tag. \nIf the data is to be queried from a SPARQL end point, the ENDPOINT tag must be set to the corresponding SPARQL endpoint URI.\nIn case the data is stored in a local file (CSV, N3, TURTLE, etc.), ENDPOINT tag must be set to the absolute path of the file containing the data.\n\n\nThe VAR tag describes the variable associated with the aformentioned endpoint. This variable is also used later, when specifying the metric used to link the entities retrieved from the source and target endpoints.\nThe fourth property is set via the PAGESIZE tag. This property must be set to the maximal number of triples returned by the SPARQL endpoint. For example, the DBpedia endpoint returns a maximum of 1000 triples for each query. LIMES' SPARQL module can still retrieve all relevant instances for the mapping even the value is set. If the SPARQL endpoint does not limit the number of triples it returns or if the input is a file, the value of PAGESIZE should be set to -1. \nThe restrictions on the queried data can be set via the RESTRICTION tag. This tag allows to constrain the entries that are retrieved the LIMES' query module. In this particular example, we only use instances of MESH concepts. Additionally, multiple RESTRICTION tags are allowed per data source.\nThe PROPERTY tag allows to specify the properties that will be used during the linking. It is important to note that the property tag can also be used to specify the preprocessing on the input data. For example, setting rdfs:label AS nolang, one can ensure that the language tags get removed from each rdfs:label before it is written in the cache. Pre-processing functions can be piped into one another by using ->. For example, rdfs:label AS nolang->lowercase will compute lowercase(nolang(rdfs:label)). If you are not sure if all your entities have a certain property you can use the OPTIONAL_PROPERTY tag instead of PROPERTY. Additionally, multiple PROPERTY tags are allowed per data source.\n\nOptional properties can be set to segment the requested dataset.\n\nThe graph of the endpoint can be specified directly ofter the ENDPOINT tag using the GRAPH tag.\nThe limits of the query can be set with the MINOFFSET and MAXOFFSET tags directly after the PAGESIZE tag. The resulting query will ask about the statements in the interval [MINOFFSET, MAXOFFSET]. Note that MINOFFSET must be smaller than MAXOFFSET! If both SOURCE and TARGET are restricted, a warning is generated.\n\nPre-processing Functions\nSimple\nCurrently, LIMES supports the following set of pre-processing functions:\n\nnolang for removing language tags\nlowercase for converting the input string into lower case\nuppercase for converting the input string into upper case \nnumber for ensuring that only the numeric characters, \".\" and \",\" are contained in the input string\nreplace(String a,String b) for replacing each occurrence of a with b\nregexreplace(String x,String b) for replacing each occurrence the regular excepression x with b\ncleaniri for removing all the prefixes from IRIs\ncelsius for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius\nfahrenheit for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit\nremovebraces for removing the braces\nregularAlphabet for removing nun-alphanumeric characters\nuriasstring returns the last part of a URI as a String. Additional parsing _ as space\n\nSometimes, generating the right link specification might either require merging property values (for example, the dc:title and foaf:name of MESH concepts) or splitting property values (for example, comparing the label and foaf:homepage of source instances and the foaf:homepage of target instances as well as foaf:homepage AS cleaniri of the target instances with the rdfs:label of target instances. To enable this, LIMES provides the RENAME operator which simply store either the values of a property or the results of a preprocessing into a different property field. For example, foaf:homepage AS cleaniri RENAME label would store the homepage of an object without all the prefixes in the name property. The user could then access this value during the specification of the similarity measure for comparing sources and target instances. Note that the same property value can be used several times. Thus, the following specification fragment is valid and leads to the the dc:title and foaf:name of individuals)  of MESH concepts being the first cast down to the lowercase and then merged to a single property.\n\n    mesh\n    http://mesh.bio2rdf.org/sparql\n    ?y\n    5000\n    ?y rdf:type meshr:Concept\n    dc:title AS lowercase RENAME name\n    foaf:name AS lowercase RENAME name\n    sparql\n\n\nIn addition, the following allows splitting the values of foaf:homepage into the property values name and homepage.\n\n    mesh\n    http://mesh.bio2rdf.org/sparql\n    ?y\n    5000\n    ?y rdf:type meshr:Concept\n    foaf:homepage AS lowercase RENAME homepage\n    foaf:homepage AS cleaniri->lowercase RENAME name\n    sparql\n\n\nComplex\nIt is also possible to use complex pre-processing functions, i.e. functions that manipulate multiple values at once.\nCurrently the following complex pre-processing functions are available:\n\nconcat(property1, property2, glue=\",\") RENAME newprop this concatenates the values of property1 and property2 into newprop using a comma as glue between the values. The use of the glue= argument is optional. So concat(property1, property2) RENAME newprop would be valid as well.\nsplit(property, splitChar=\",\") RENAME prop1,prop2 this splits the values of property on the comma character, the first part is stored in prop1 the rest in prop2. The splitChar= argument is mandatory. You can control the maximum number of splits by providing more or less properties after the RENAME keyword. For example if you would write RENAME prop1,prop2,prop3 the values of property would be split into at most 3 values if 3 or more commas are present.\ntoWktPoint(property1, property2) RENAME wktPoint this takes the values of property1 and property2 and stores them as POINT(p1 p2). The values of the two properties have to be numbers.\n\nComplex pre-processing functions are provided using the FUNCTION tag.\n\n    mesh\n    http://dbpedia.org/sparql\n    ?y\n    5000\n    ?y rdf:type dbo:Airport\n    rdfs:label\n    geo:lat\n    geo:long\n    toWktPoint(geo:lat, geo:long) RENAME geoWktPoint\n    sparql\n\n\nPlease note that complex functions always require the RENAME operation.\nSource types\nA source type can be set via TYPE. The default type is set to SPARQL\n(for a SPARQL endpoint) but LIMES also supports reading files directly from\nthe hard-drive. The supported data formats are:\n\nCSV: Character-separated file can be loaded directly into LIMES.\nNote that the separation character is set to TAB as a default. \nThe user can alter this setting programmatically. \nN3 (which also reads NT files) reads files in the N3 language.\nN-TRIPLE reads files in W3C's core \nN-Triples format\nTURTLE allows reading files in the\nTurtle syntax.\n\nMoreover, if you want to download data from a SPARQL endpoint, there is\nno need to set the  tag. \nInstead, if you want to read the source (or target) data from a file,\nyou should fill  tag with the absolute path of the input file, \n.g. C:/Files/dbpedia.nt, and you should also set the\n tag  with the type of the input data, for example NT.\nMetric Expression for Similarity Measurement\nOne of the core improvements of the newest LIMES kernels is the provision of a highly flexible\nlanguage for the specification of complex metrics for linking\n(set by using the METRIC tag as exemplified below).\n\n    trigrams(y.dc:title, x.linkedct:condition_name)\n\n\nIn this example, we use the trigrams metric to compare the dc:title of\nthe instances retrieved from the source data source (with which the\nvariable y is associated) with the linkedct:condition (with which the\nvariable x is associated).\nFor detailed instructions on how to assemble a valid link specification\nand a complete catalogue of all measure types included in LIMES, see Defining Link Specifications\nExecution (optional) \nThree LIMES execution parameters could be set here:\n\nREWRITER: LIMES 1.0.0 implements the DEFAULT rewriter.\nPLANNER: the user can choose between:\nCANONICAL: It generates an immutable plan in a static manner.\nHELIOS: It generates an immutable plan in a dynamic manner.\nDYNAMIC: It generates an mutable plan in a dynamic manner.\nDEFAULT: same as CANONICAL.\n\n\nENGINE: the user can choose between:\nSIMPLE: It executes each independent part of the plan sequentially.\nDEFAULT: same as SIMPLE.\n\n\n\nIf not set, the DEFAULT value for each parameter will be used.\nMachine Learning (optional) \nIn most cases, finding a good link specification (i.e. one that achieves high F-Measure)\nis not a trivial task.\nTherefore, we implemented a number of machine learning algorithm for auto-generation\nof link specifications.\nIn order to use a machine learning algorithm in your configuration file,\nput the MLALGORITHM tag instead of the METRIC tag.\nFor example:\n\n    wombat simple\n    supervised batch\n    trainingData.nt\n     \n        max execution time in minutes\n        60\n    \n\n\nFor more information on the meaning and possible values of the elements within the MLALGORITHM tag,\nplease refer to [Defining Machine Learning Tasks]{./defining_ml_tasks.md}.\nGranularity (optional) \nThe user can choose positive integers to set the granularity of HYPPO, HR3 or ORCHID by setting\n2.\nAcceptance Condition\nFilling the acceptance condition consists of setting the threshold value to the minimum value that two instances must have in order to satisfy a relation. This can be carried out as exemplified below. \n\n    0.98\n    accepted.nt\n    owl:sameAs\n\n\nBy using the THRESHOLD tag, the user can set the minimum value that two instances must have in order to satisfy the relation specified in the RELATION tag, i.e., owl:sameAs in our example. Setting the tag  allows to specify where the links should be written. Currently, LIMES produces output files in the N3 format.\nFuture versions of LIMES will allow to write the output to other streams and in other data formats.\nReview Condition\nSetting the condition upon which links must be reviewed manually is very similar to setting the acceptance condition as shown below.\n\n    0.95\n    reviewme.nt\n    owl:sameAs\n\n\nAll instances that have a similarity

Specifications","keywords":"","body":"Defining Link Specifications\nLinks Specifications (LS) can be simple or complex.\nA simple LS just consists of the measure name together with the arguments to the measure.\nPossible arguments to a measure are all properties as defined in Data Sources. \nA possible simple LS is shown in the following example:\ntrigrams(x.rdfs:label,y.dc:title)\n\nWhile such simple metrics can be used in many cases, complex metrics are\nnecessary in complex linking cases.\nLIMES includes a formal grammar for specifying complex configurations of\narbitrary complexity.\nFor this purpose, two categories of binary operations are supported:\n\nMetric operations and \nBoolean operations.\n\nMetric operations\nMetric operations allow to combine metric values. They include the operators\nMIN, MAX and ADD e.g. as follows:\nMAX(trigrams(x.rdfs:label,y.dc:title)|0.3,euclidean(x.lat|long, y.latitude|longitude)|0.5).\nThis specification computes the maximum of:\n\nThe trigram similarity of x's rdfs:label and y's dc:title is greater or equal to 0.3\nThe 2-dimension Euclidean distance of x's lat and long with y's latitude and longitude, i.e.,  ((x.latâˆ’y.latitude)2+(x.longâˆ’y.longitude)2) \\sqrt{((x.lat- y.latitude)^2 + (x.long - y.longitude)^2)} âˆšâ€‹((x.latâˆ’y.latitude)â€‹2â€‹â€‹+(x.longâˆ’y.longitude)â€‹2â€‹â€‹)â€‹â€‹â€‹ is greater or equal to 0.5. \n\nNote that euclidean supports arbitrarily many dimensions. In addition, note that ADD allows to define weighted sums as follows:ADD(0.3*trigrams(x.rdfs:label,y.dc:title)|0.3, 0.7*euclidean(x.lat|x.long,y.latitude|y.longitude)|0.5).\nWe call trigrams(x.rdfs:label,y.dc:title)|0.3 the left child of the specification and euclidean(x.lat|long, y.latitude|longitude)|0.5 the right child of the specification. Both children specifications are simple specifications and combined with a metric operator, they create a complex specification. LIMES gives the user the opportunity to combine exactly two complex or simple specifications to create a new complex specification. Note that each child specification must be accompanied by its own threshold.\nBoolean operations\nBoolean operations allow to combine and filter the results of metric operations and include AND, OR, DIFF, e.g. as AND(trigrams(x.rdfs:label,y.dc:title)|0.9, euclidean(x.lat|x.long, y.latitude|y.longitude)|0.7).\nThis specification returns all links such that:\n\nthe trigram similarity of x's rdfs:label and y's dc:title is greater or equal to 0.9 and\nthe 2-dimension euclidean distance of x's lat and long mit y's latitude and longitude is greater or equal to 0.7.\n\nWe call trigrams(x.rdfs:label,y.dc:title)|0.9 the left child of the speficiation and euclidean(x.lat|x.long, y.latitude|y.longitude)|0.7the right child of the specification. Both children specifications are simple specifications and combined with a boolean operator, they create a complex specification.\nLIMES gives the user the opportunity to combine exactly two complex or simple spefications to create a new complex specification. Note that each child specification must be accompanied by its own threshold.\nImplemented Measures\nMeasures are organized in packages, based on the type of resource they are designed to operate with. \nSeveral measure packages ship with LIMES and it is easy to extend it with your own.\nThe current version of LIMES ships with the following measure packages:\n\nString measures\nVector space measures\nPoint-set measures\nTopological measures\nTemporal measures\nResource-set measures\n\nMore complex distance measures are being added continuously.\nWe give more details about each of the measure type in the following sections.\nString Measures\nThe string measures package consists of the following measures: \n\nCosine: Cosine string similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors\nrepresentations of the two input strings of an inner product space that measures the cosine of\nthe angle between them. The outcome of the Cosine string similarity is neatly bounded in [0,1][0,1][0,1]\nExactMatch: Exact match string similarity is a measure of similarity between two input\nstrings that returns one in case the two input strings were identical, zero otherwise.\nJaccard: The Jaccard index, also known as Intersection over Union and the Jaccard similarity\ncoefficient (originally coined coefficient de communautÃ© by Paul Jaccard), is a statistic used for\ncomparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets. The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity\nbetween finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of\nthe union of the sample sets. In LIMES, we use trigrams of the input strings to generate our sample sets. \nOverlap: The overlap coefficient or Szymkiewiczâ€“Simpson coefficient, is a similarity measure\nthat measures the overlap between two sets. It is related to the Jaccard index and is defined as\nthe size of the intersection divided by the smaller of the size of the two sets.\nJaro: The Jaro distance between two strings is related to the minimum number of single-character\ntranspositions required to change one string into the other.\nJaroWinkler: The Jaroâ€“Winkler distance is a string metric for measuring the edit\ndistance between two sequences. It is a variant proposed in 1990 by William E. Winkler of the Jaro\ndistance metric. The Jaroâ€“Winkler distance uses a prefix scale which gives more favourable\nratings to strings that match from the beginning for a set prefix length. The lower\nthe Jaroâ€“Winkler distance for two strings is, the more similar the strings are. The score is\nnormalized such that 0 equates to no similarity and 1 is an exact match.\nLevenshtein: The Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference\nbetween two strings. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two strings is the minimum number\nof single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one string into\nthe other. It is named after the Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein, who considered this\ndistance in 1965. Normalized Levenshtein distance is computed by dividing the Levenshtein distance\nby the length of the input string. Let dlvnd_{lvn}dâ€‹lvnâ€‹â€‹ be the normalized Levenshtein distance.\nThen we define the Levenshtein similarity in LIMES as 11âˆ’dlvn\\frac{1}{1-d_{lvn}}â€‹1âˆ’dâ€‹lvnâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹1â€‹â€‹.\nMongeElkan: The Monge-Elkan similarity measure is a type of hybrid similarity measure that\ncombines the benefits of sequence-based and set-based methods. This can be effective for domains\nin which more control is needed over the similarity measure. In LIMES, we use trigrams of the input\nstrings to generate our sample string subsets.\nRatcliffObershelp: In Ratcliff/Obershelp, we compute the similarity of the two input strings\nas the number of matching characters divided by the total number of characters in the two strings.\nMatching characters are those in the longest common subsequence plus, recursively, matching characters\nin the unmatched region on either side of the longest common subsequence.\nSoundex: Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced in English.\nThe goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched\ndespite minor differences in spelling. The algorithm mainly encodes consonants, a vowel will not be\nencoded unless it is the first letter. In LIMES, we compute the Soundex similarity score as the reverse of\nthe distance between the encoding of the two input strings. \nKoeln: This phonetic similarity measure uses the Cologne phonetics algorithm which is closely\nrelated to the previously mentioned Soundex algorithm but is optimized to match the German language.\nIn LIMES, we compute the Koeln similarity score as the reverse of the distance between the Cologne \nphonetics encoding of the two input strings.\nDoubleMetaphone: This is a phonetic algorithm for indexing words by their English pronunciation.\nIt was designed based on the Soundex algorithm and aims to deal with most of its shortcomings.\nIn LIMES, we compute the DoubleMetaphone similarity score as the reverse of the distance between the\nDoubleMetaphone encoding of the two input strings.\nTrigram: A tri-gram is a group of three consecutive characters taken from a string.\nIn LIMES, we measure the similarity of two input strings by counting the number of trigrams they share.\nFormally, we compute the trigram similarity as the normalized sum of absolute differences between\ntri-gram vectors of both the input strings.\nQgrams: Same as trigram but using a group of qqq (set to four by default) consecutive characters for generating\nthe q-gram vectors of the input strings.\n\nVector Space Measures\nLIMES supports comparing numeric vectors by using the vector space measures package consisting of the following measures:\n\nEuclidean: Euclidean metric is the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.\nWith this distance, Euclidean space becomes a metric space.\nFor example, euclidean(a.wgs84:lat|wgs84:long,b.wgs84:lat|wgs84:long) will compute the Euclidean\ndistance between the point representations of each resource from the source and target datasets.\nManhattan: Manhattan metric defines the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.\n\nPoint-Set Measures\nThe similarity between polygons can be measured by using the following point-set distances:\n\nGeo_Hausdorff: The Hausdorff distance is a measure of the maximum of the minimum distances\nbetween pairwise points in the two input geometries. \nGeo_Max: The idea behind this measure is to compute the overall maximal distance between\npairwise points of the two input geometries.\nGeo_Min: The idea of Geo_Min is akin to that of Geo_Max and is defined as minimal distance\nbetween pairwise points of the two input geometries.\nGeo_Mean: The mean distance is one of the most efficient distance measures for point sets.\nFirst, a mean point is computed for each point set. Then, the distance be- tween the two means is\ncomputed by using the orthodromic distance. \nGeo_Avg: For computing the average point sets distance function, the orthodromic distance\nmeasures between all the source-target geometriesâ€™ points pairs is cumulated and divided by the\nnumber of points in the source-target geometriesâ€™ point pairs.\nGeo_Frechet: The FrÃ©chet distance is a measure of similarity between curves (in our case\ngeometries representations of the POI resources) that takes into account the location and ordering\nof the points along the curves. \nGeo_Sum_Of_Min: First, the closest point from the source geometry to each point to the target\ngeometry is computed. The same operation is carried out with source and target reversed.\nFinally, the average of the two values is then the distance value.\nGeo_Naive_Surjection: The surjection distance function introduced defines the distance between\ntwo geometries as the minimum distance between the sum of distances of the surjection of the larger\nset to the smaller one. A main drawback of the surjection is being biased toward some points ignoring\nsome others in calculations. \nGeo_Fair_Surjection: In order to fix the bias of the Geo_Naive_Surjection, the fair-surjection\ndistance maps the elements of source geometry as evenly as possible to the elements of the target geometry. \nGeo_Link: The Link distance is defined as the minimum orthodromic distance between pairwise\npoints of the source and target geometries that satisfy the bijection relation. \n\nFor all the above measures, the threshold Î¸\\thetaÎ¸ corresponds to the distance xxx between two\npoints in km via Î¸=11+x\\theta = \\frac{1}{1+x}Î¸=â€‹1+xâ€‹â€‹1â€‹â€‹.\nTopological Measures\nThe topological relations between spatial representations of POI resources can be found by using\nthe following relations.\nIn these relations we assume that the first POI resource has a geospatial representation in a form\nof geometry a and the target POI resource has a geospatial representation in a form of geometry b:\n\nTop_Contains: A geometry a contains geometry b if and only if no points of b lie in the exterior\nof a, and at least one point of the interior of b lies in the interior of a.\nTop_Covers: A geometry a covers geometry b if and only if the geometry b lies in a. i.e. no points\nof b lie in the exterior of a, or Every point of b is a point of (the interior or boundary of) a.\nTop_Covered_By: A geometry a is covered by a geometry b if and only if every point of a is a\npoint of b, and the interiors of the two geometries have at least one point in common. Note that\nTop_Covered_By is the reverse relation of Top_Covers.\nTop_Crosses: A geometry a crosses a geometry b if and only if they have some but not all\ninterior points in common, and the dimension of the intersection is less than that of at least one of them. \nTop_Disjoint: Two geometries a and b are disjoint if and only if they have no point in common.\nThey form a set of disconnected geometries.\nTop_Equals: Two geometries a and b are topologically equal if their interiors intersect and\nno part of the interior or boundary of one geometry intersects the exterior of the other.\nTop_Intersects: A geometry a intersects A geometry b if and only if geometries a and b have\nat least one point in common.\nTop_Overlaps: A geometry a overlaps a geometry b if and only if they have some but not all\npoints in common, they have the same dimension and the intersection of the interiors of the two\ngeometries has the same dimension as the geometries themselves\nTop_Touches: Two geometries a and touched if they have at least one boundary point in\ncommon, but no interior points.\nTop_Within: A geometry a is within a geometry b if and only if a lies in the interior of b.\n\nTemporal Measures\nThe temporal relations between POI resources can be found by using the following relations:\n\nTmp_Concurrent: given a source and a target KB, Tmp_Concurrent links the source and the target\nevents that have the same begin date and were produced by the same machine. For example:\nTmp_Concurrent(x.beginDate1|machine1,y.beginDate2|machine2)|1.0 \nTmp_Predecessor: given a source and a target KB, vmp_Predecessor links the source events to\nthe set of target events that happen exactly before them. For example:\nTmp_Predecessor (x.beginDate1, y.beginDate2)|1.0.\nIf the Tmp_Predecessor measure is used in a complex LS, the CANONICAL planner should be used. \nTmp_Successor: given a source and a target KB, Tmp_Successor links the source events to the\nset of target events that happen exactly after them. For example: Tmp_Successor (x.beginDate1, y.beginDate2)|1.0.\nIf the Tmp_Successor measure is used in a complex LS, the CANONICAL planner should be used. \n\nMoreover, LIMES support the following temporal relations between POI resources based on Allen's algebra:\n\nTmp_After: The first POI takes place after the second POI takes place.\nTmp_Before: The first POI takes place before the second POI takes place.\nTmp_During: The first POI take place during the second POI takes place.\nTmp_During_Reverse: The second POI take place during the first POI takes place. Tmp_During_Reverse is the reverse of Tmp_During\nTmp_Equals: Both first POI and the second take place concurrently. i.e. both POIs have equal timestamp.\nTmp_Finishes: The first POI finishes in the same time as the second POI finishes.\nTmp_Is_Finished_By: reverse of Tmp_Finishes\nTmp_Overlaps: Part of the first POI timestamp overlaps with the second POI time stamp.\nTmp_Is_Overlapped_By: reverse of Tmp_Overlaps\nTmp_Starts: The start first POI timestamp is the same as the start of the second POI time stamp.\nTmp_Is_Started_By: reverse of Tmp_Starts\nTmp_Meets: The end first POI timestamp meets the start of the second POI time stamp.\nTmp_Is_xBy: reverse of Tmp_Meets\n\nBelow, an example of an atomic LS that consists of the temporal measure Tmp_Finishes and a threshold Î¸=1.0\\theta = 1.0Î¸=1.0 is given: \nTmp_Finishes(x.beginDate1|endDate1, y.beginDate2|endDate2) | 0.8\nwhere beginDate1 and beginDate2 are properties of the source and target KB respectively, whose values\nindicate the begin of a temporal event instance and endDate1 and endDate2 are properties of the source\nand target KB respectively, whose values indicate the end of a temporal event instance.\nBoth begin and end properties for both source and target MUST be included in an atomic LS whose\nmeasure is temporal. Also, the acceptable values for all properties are in the format: 2015-04-22T11:29:51+02:00.\nResource-Set Measures\nTo compare sets of resources (e.g. in rdf containers), use the following relations:\n\nSet_Jaccard: Works much like the jaccard measure for strings with the difference that it expects\nthe inputs to be sets of RDF resources.\n\nPlease note that RDF collections are not supported yet.\n"},"user_manual/configuration_file/defining_ml_tasks.html":{"url":"user_manual/configuration_file/defining_ml_tasks.html","title":"Defining Machine Learning Tasks","keywords":"","body":"Defining Machine Learning Tasks\nIn the following we will detail the contents of the MLALGORITHM tag\nthat users can use to configure LIMES for machine learning.\nConsider the following example from the configuration file:\n\n    wombat simple\n    supervised batch\n    trainingData.nt\n     \n        max execution time in minutes\n        60\n    \n\n\n\nThe tag NAME contains the name of the machine learning algorithm.

Each metric corresponds to one mapper. One mapper can correspond to more that one metric. The Measures package is divided into two sub-packages: Measure and Mapper:\n\nThe Measure packages include the interface IMeasure, the abstract class AMeasure, the set of metrics implemented in LIMES, a MeasureType class, a MeasureFactory class and a MeasureProcessor class:\n\nThe IMeasure interface includes all the basic functions that any metric class must implement.\nThe AMeasure class implements the IMeasure interface.\nThe MeasureType class includes all the labels of the metrics implemented in LIMES. \nThe metrics are divided into type packages based on the type of property they are comparing (string, pointsets, space, topology and space). Each type package includes an interface and an abstract class, i.e. the string type package includes the IStringMeasure interface and the IStringMeasure abstract class. All metrics that belong to a particular type package must implement the corresponding interface and abstract class. Additionally, the type package abstract class must extend AMeasure and implement the corresponding type interface. The type interface must extend the IMeasure interface. \nThe MeasureFactory class returns an object of a measure given an input measure name. \nThe MeasureProcessor class is responsible for returning the similarity between two instances, given a simple or complex metric expression and a threshold.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to create a new measure, you have to follow a set of steps:\n\nIn case a suitable type package exists then:\n\nThe new metric name must end with the word Measure.\nThe new metric must extend the type abstract class.\nThe new metric must implement all overridden methods of the type interface. No unsupported functions are allowed.\nGo to the MeasureType class and add a representative name of that metric.\nGo to the MeasureFactory class and create a public static final field of String type using the same name of metric as the one used in the MeasureType class i.e. public static final String COSINE = \"cosine\"; and then add the choice of returning this measure at the getMeasureType and createMeasure functions following the pattern used for other metrics.\n\n\nIn case you want to create a new type package:\n\nCreate a new type abstract class that extends AMeasure implements IStringMeasure.\nCreate a new type interface that extends IMeasure.\nFollow steps 1-5 described above.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mapper has almost the same hierarchy as the Measure package.

All mappers must extend the AMapper abstract class.\nThe MapperFactory class returns an object of a mapper given an input measure name. \nThe MappingOperations includes the basic functions between mappings.\n\n\nIf you want to create a new mapper, you have to follow a set of steps:\n\nThe new mapper name must include the word Mapper at the end.\nThe new mapper must extend the AMapper abstract class as a result, it must implement all overridden methods of the IMapper interface.

For an atomic LS, it generates a simple Plan that consists of a RUN command. For a complex LS, it determines which atomic LS should be executed first, how to process intermediary results and identifies dependencies between atomic LSs. For example, a Planner can decide to first run some atomic LS and then filter the results using another atomic LS instead of running it independently and merging the results.\nAn ExecutionEngine is responsible for executing the Plan of an input LS. It takes as input a LS and a Planner, it executes  the Plan and returns the set of links as a AMapping.\nAll packages have the same hierarchy and they include the following set of classes:\nAn interface i.e. IExecutionEngine that includes all basic functions that an engine must implement.\nAn abstract class i.e. ExecutionEngine that implements the IExecutionEngine interface and must be extended by all engine classes.\nA factory class i.e. ExecutionEngineFactory that returns an object of an engine given an input engine name. \n\n\n\nThis code example, taken from the LSPipeline class, demonstrates the usage pattern:\nRewriter rw = RewriterFactory.getRewriter(rewriterType);\nLinkSpecification rwLs = rw.rewrite(ls);\n// Planning execution of the LS\nPlanner planner = ExecutionPlannerFactory.getPlanner(executionPlannerType, sourceCache, targetCache);\n// Execute the ExecutionPlan obtained from the LS\nExecutionEngine engine = ExecutionEngineFactory.getEngine(executionEngineType, sourceCache, targetCache, sourceVar, targetVar);\nreturn engine.execute(rwLs, planner);\n\nIf you want to create a new engine or planner or rewriter class, you must follow a set of steps:\n\nThe name of the new class must end with the word \"Engine\" or \"Planner\" or \"Rewriter\".\nThe new class must extend the ExecutionEngine or Planner or Rewriter abstract class and as a result implement all overriden methods from the corresponding interface. No unsupported functions are allowed.\nGo to the corresponding Factory class of the package and include a label for the new class at the enum class of allowed names. Then, create a public static final field of String type using the same name of engine/planner/rewriter as the one used in the enum class i.e. public static final String HELIOS = \"helios\"; and finally then add the choice of returing this engine/planner/rewriter at the i.e. getPlannerType and getPlanner functions following the pattern used for other engines/planners/rewriters.\n\n\n\n"},"developer_manual/ml_pipeline.html":{"url":"developer_manual/ml_pipeline.html","title":"MLPipeline","keywords":"","body":"MLPipeline\nThe MLPipeline acts as a simple facade for the three MLImplementationTypes of MLAlgorithms LIMES 1.0 offers: UNSUPERVISED, SUPERVISED_BATCH, SUPERVISED_ACTIVE.\nIn the following the pattern for invoking a MLAlgorithm is presented.\nBecause many algorithms can support more than one MLImplementationType, to minimize redundant code, MLAlgorithm's should be implemented by extending the abstract class ACoreMLAlgorithm. ACoreMLAlgorithm's interface covers all three types, but not all three need to be implemented.\nFor each MLImplementationType there is a decorator class extending AMLAlgorithm. To use any MLAlgorithm in a safe way, pass its class type to the constructor of the decorator class corresponding to the MLImplementationType, e.g.:\nClass clazz = WombatComplete.class;\nUnsupervisedMLAlgorithm mlu = new UnsupervisedMLAlgorithm(clazz);\nThere also exists an MLAlgorithmFactory which offers a method getAlgorithmType(String name) to retrieve class types of algorithms from their names .\nThe usage patterns for the MLImplementationTypes are as follows:\nUnsupervised Learning\nIn unsupervised learning, predictions are made based on the structure of existing data. A helpful concept for unsupervised learning of links between knowledge bases is the so called Pseudo-F-measure (PFM). PFMs can be defined in various ways, but generally they are used to evaluate the intermediary results of the unsupervised learning algorithm, based only on its structure.\nInitialization works the same across all cases of ML. For unsupervised learning, we then pass a PFM to the learn() method, which returns an instance of class MLResults. We can use this result as a parameter to the predict function, which allows us to, for example, learn on smaller subsets of our data and then apply the learned classificators to the whole dataset.\nUnsupervisedMLAlgorithm mlu = new UnsupervisedMLAlgorithm(clazz);\nmlu.init(learningParameters, source, target);\nmlm = mlu.learn(pfm);\nmlu.predict(source, target, mlm);\nSupervised Batch Learning\nIn supervised batch learning, you learn to classify resp. evaluate future (a priori unknown) observations by looking at sufficiently many training examples, which are all known at the start of the algorithm.\nFor this to work really good, a lot of training data is needed.\nThe usage in limes is analogous to the unsupervised case, except this time, we do not pass a PFM to the learn() method. Instead, we pass it an instance of AMapping which stores our training data.\nSupervisedMLAlgorithm mls = new SupervisedMLAlgorithm(clazz);\nmls.init(learningParameters, source, target);\nmlm = mls.learn(trainingDataMap);\nmls.predict(source, target, mlm);\nSupervised Active Learning\nActive learning is like batch learning, except that the training examples are generated on the fly, by selecting example observations upon which different intermediary results of the algorithm disagree the most. An oracle (mostly a human expert) is then prompted to evaluate the selected examples, which are then fed back into the algorithm as training examples.\nThis is why in LIMES an active learning algorithm's activeLearn method can be called without parameters, e.g. for the first step of selecting appropriate examples for user evaluation (which is actually unsupervised), or it can be called with an instance of AMapping, storing the training examples.\nFor retrieving the examples for user evaluation, the getNextExamples method returns an instance of AMapping.\nActiveMLAlgorithm mla = new ActiveMLAlgorithm(clazz);\nmla.init(learningParameters, source, target);\nmlm = mla.activeLearn(); \nAMapping nextExamples = mla.getNextExamples(maxIterations);\n// retrieve assessments from oracle and update scores in nextExamples accordingly\nmlm = mla.activeLearn(nextExamples);\nmla.predict(source, target, mlm);\n"},"misc/faq.html":{"url":"misc/faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\nWhat is LIMES?\nLIMES is a link discovery framework for the Web of Data. It implements time-efficient approaches for large-scale link discovery based on the characteristics of metric spaces. \nProblems with JavaFX?\nWhile Oracle Java 8 should have JavaFX included, with OpenJDK for Java 8 it depends whether the package assembler chooses to \ninclude JavaFX. And in some cases it can happen, that neither works. \nThe first thing you should do is check if you can find jfxrt.jar, it should be in /lib/ext/jfxrt.jar (but in this\ncase everything should be working just fine). If you find it somewhere else, you have to put it on the classpath. A guide\non how to do this can be found here. If this does not work, trying to reinstall java would be a good\nidea (if you've used OpenJDK before try Oracle Java!).\nIf this doesn't work, in Ubuntu versions 15.04 upwards you can install JavaFX separately using sudo apt-get install openjfx.\nUnfortunately, this package seems unavailable for lower Ubuntu versions (Although there is always the possibility to \nbuild it yourself or use community builds).\nFrom Oracle Java version 11 onwards, JavaFX is not part of the JDK anymore. We are currently working on getting LIMES running in Oracle Java >= 11.\nIn the meantime, please use an older version to build LIMES. \n"}}}
